/**
 * Any incoming connection is represented by this interface.
 *
 * An incoming connection is a duplex stream (both readable and writable) that
 * implements React's DuplexStreamInterface.
 * It contains additional properties for the local and remote address (client IP)
 * where this connection has been established from.
 *
 * Note that this interface is only to be used to represent the server-side end
 * of an incoming connection.
 * It MUST NOT be used to represent an outgoing connection in a client-side
 * context.
 * If you want to establish an outgoing connection,
 * use React's SocketClient component instead.
 *
 * Because the `ConnectionInterface` implements the underlying
 * `DuplexStreamInterface` you can use any of its events and methods as usual:
 *
 * ```php
 * $connection->on('data', function ($chunk) {
 *     echo $chunk;
 * });
 *
 * $connection->on('end', function () {
 *     echo 'ended';
 * });
 *
 * $connection->on('error', function (Exception $e) {
 *     echo 'error: ' . $e->getMessage();
 * });
 *
 * $connection->on('close', function () {
 *     echo 'closed';
 * });
 *
 * $connection->write($data);
 * $connection->end($data = null);
 * $connection->close();
 * // â€¦
 * ```
 *
 * For more details, see the
 * [`DuplexStreamInterface`](https://github.com/reactphp/stream#duplexstreaminterface).
