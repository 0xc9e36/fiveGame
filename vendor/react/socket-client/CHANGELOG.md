## 0.5.0 (2016-03-19)

* Feature / BC break: Support Connector without DNS
  (#46 by @clue)

  BC break: The `Connector` class now serves as a BC layer only.
  The `TcpConnector` and `DnsConnector` classes replace its functionality.
  If you're merely *using* this class, then you're *recommended* to upgrade as
  per the below snippet â€“ existing code will still work unchanged.
  If you're `extend`ing the `Connector` (generally not recommended), then you
  may have to rework your class hierarchy.

  ```php
// old (still supported, but marked deprecated)
$connector = new Connector($loop, $resolver);

// new equivalent
$connector = new DnsConnector(new TcpConnector($loop), $resolver);

// new feature: supports connecting to IP addresses only
$connector = new TcpConnector($loop);
```
